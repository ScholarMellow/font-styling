<p>Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.<em><span> Fluff that up.</span></em> We'll have a super time. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Get tough with it, get strong.

As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Use what you see, don't plan it. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.</p>

<p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. A beautiful little sunset. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.</p>
